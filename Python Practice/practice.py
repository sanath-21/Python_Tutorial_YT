# 1) Python program to interchange first and last elements in a list
# def User():
#     n = int(input("How many values do you want to enter in the list? : "))
#     l = [int(input(f"Enter {i+1} values: ")) for i in range(n)]
#     temp = l[0]
#     l[0] = l[-1]
#     l[-1] = temp
#     print(l)
    
# User()

# 2) Write a Python code to find the Maximum of these two numbers.

# def maximum():
#     num1 = int(input("Enter 1st Number: "))
#     num2 = int(input("Enter 2nd Number: "))

#     if num1>num2:
#         print(f"{num1} is greater than {num2}")
#     elif num1==num2:  
#         print(f"{num1} is equal to {num2}") 
#     else:
#         print(f"{num2} is greater than {num1}")

# maximum()
